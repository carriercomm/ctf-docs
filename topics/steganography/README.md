#Steganography

Steganography [is the art or practice of concealing a message, image, or file within another message, image, or file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography), and in the context of CTFs usually means finding the hints and flags that have been hidden with steganography.  Most commonly a picture or image file will be given as a task with no further instructions, and the participants have to be able to uncover the message that has been encoded in the media.

###Example

Images are a very common medium for steganography, as they are easy to manipulate and simple to view and transport. [Files in Images](files-in-images) give a good introduction for beginner steganography.

##Getting Started

A rudimentary knowledge of media filetypes (e.g. jpg, bmp, png for pictures and wav, mp3 for sound) is essential to steganography, as understanding in what ways files can be hidden and obscured is crucial. Also, understanding basic linux is important, as a multitude of tools are specifically for bash.
