#Vigenère Cipher

> The Vigenère Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword -- [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher). 

Please read the article on [Caesar Ciphers](../caesar-cipher), if you already haven't, because the Vigenère Cipher practically takes a keyword, and applies a certain caeser cipher multiple times according to the letters of the keyword.

*To-Do Example*

##Detecting

Vigenère Ciphers appear to be identical to any other substitution cipher, but trying to solve it as Caesar Cipher will not work.  Attempt to check for this type of cipher if the Caesar Cipher crack does not work.

##Solving

*To-Do*

##CTF Example

DEKTHON 2014 had a simple vigenère cipher with no hints and only a line of text:

`ucoizsbtkxhtadcg`
