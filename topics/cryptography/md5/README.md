#MD5 Hashing

MD5 is a [widely used cryptographic hash function producing a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value, typically expressed in text format as a 32 digit hexadecimal number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5). This system is commonly used to check that a download is uncorrupted or as security to check that files are not tampered with.  The way MD5 hashes are created, any slight variation in a file creates a new MD5 hash that is completely different than the previous, making changes in files (e.g. corruption in download or tampering) very apparent.

Creating an md5 hash is very simple, as there are multiple online tools like [md5-creator](http://www.md5-creator.com/) and even a command line tool [md5sum](http://linux.about.com/library/cmd/blcmdl1_md5sum.htm) which will quickly create a sum from input.

##Detecting

MD5 hashes are very standard, as they are always 128 bits, or 32-character strings.
