#Miscellaneous

Many challenges in CTFs will be completely random and unprecedented, requiring simply logic, knowledge, and patience to be solved.  There is no sure-fire way to prepare for these, but as you complete more CTFs you will be able to recognize and hopefully have more clues as to how to solve them.

###Examples

In recent CTFs the sheer variety of miscellaneous tasks has been highly exemplified, for example:

* In the [Sochi Olympic CTF 2014](https://ctftime.org/event/130), there was a [low-point miscellaneous challenge](https://github.com/ctfs/write-ups/tree/master/olympic-ctf-2014/crypting) which only provided a jumbled string of words. Instead of being a typical crypto challenge, the answer required competitors to draw out the word SOCHI on their keyboards.
* [RuCTF](https://ctftime.org/event/122) had a challenge which presented a [single picture of shredded strips of paper jumpled up in a random order](https://github.com/ctfs/write-ups/tree/master/ructf-2014-quals/misc-100).  The best way of solving this was by hand! No computer knowledge was even needed for its completion, only patience and a good eye.
