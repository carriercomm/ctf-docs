# Terminal

A terminal is where you will be spending a lot of time doing all sorts of stuff.

*Todo: shells, scripts ?*

## Linux

Luckily, all flavors of Linux come with a terminal built-in and you don't have to do much setup.

## Windows

There are quite a few emulators available for Windows but one that is definitely worth checking out is [Cmder](http://bliker.github.io/cmder/). It is not an emulator per se but a package of 3rd party applications and you can add stuff like [GnuWin32](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/) to get some of the cool Linux commands on windows.
