# Hex Editor

> With a hex editor, a user can see or edit the raw and exact contents of a file, as opposed to the interpretation of the same content that other, higher level application software may associate with the file format. For example, this could be raw image data, in contrast to the way image editing software would interpret and show the same file. -- [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_editor)

## Linux

Most people seem to prefer the [xxd](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/xxd1.html) command as it is fairly simple to use and you don't have to leave your terminal.

In case you are interested in a GUI based application - try [wxHexEditor](http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxhexeditor/). It is cross-platform so you can use the same setup over multiple OSes.

## Windows

There is a port of xxd for Win32 available in this [package](http://www.weihenstephan.de/~syring/win32/UnxUtilsDist.html).

[HxD](http://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/) is a nice GUI based editor.
