The general organization for this repository is `topicname/tech` or `tools/tool`. For example a page for HTTP would be `web/http/README.md` while RSA would go in `crytography/rsa/README.md`.

**Check the EXAMPLE.md file for a general overview of topic organization!** Try to stick to that model unless you find it ugly and/or non-semantic.

The first overarching topic README's (e.g. Cryptography) will most likely not follow the EXAMPLE.md, and will have their own structure to accomodate a more broad overview of the subjects.
